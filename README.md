#Earthquake Simulator

This project was done as part of my University course. The aim is to simulate the effect of a tuned mass damper (TMD) and see how it improves the stability of a building. There are four main files as part of this project 

* Frequncy Response of Model - the simulation of the model without any tuned mass damping
* Model Response with Single TMD - the simulation of how the model changes when adding a singled tuned mass damper. Notice how placing it on certain floors will increase it's effectiveness.
* Model Reponse with Multiple TMD - There are multiple resonant frequencies in the model (3 without any damping). Would it make sense to add a tuned mass damper for each frequency? 
*Optimised Number and Location for Multiple TMD - It seemed that the more dampers added, the more stable the system becomes. This program aims to see what is the optimal number of dampers, and on which floor should they be placed.
